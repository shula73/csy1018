              <p>Hi, welcome to my website.My name is Aisha Yusuf. I live at Northampton. I am a mature student. Iam study computing and I enjoy it. In Sep 2016 to June 2017 I studied at Northampton College and Iâ€™ve achieved BTEC level 3 Diploma in system support.  This course was gave me more confidence in understanding the computer system. Therefore in October 2017 I joined at University of Northampton to increase my knowledge and skills. My plan is to progress HND Computing and I will then pursue a degree in Computing. Sincerity Iam proud myself to be University because it was my dream and in a moment Iam a first year student in HND computing.</p> 
              <p>At University I learn a lot of new things that is amazing for me, teachers are very organise and helpful.	 Within my course I have six modules and some of them I found interesting such as Web developer, Program solving.  Although it was very difficult for the first time because these subjects is new for me  but, Iam getting support during the class session, now I found enjoyable, understanding and confident. </p>
               <p> My hobby is studies,talking to friends and cooking.

            <h1>Tina</h1> 
            <p>My name is Tinuke Olukoya, I am a Business Computing student at the of Northampton University. I started my academic career back in the day studying Hospitality management in Dublin. However, I had to take a break when nature called for me to become a mother of two boys. I later went back to work in the Hospitality department of the prestigious Naas General in the Republic of Ireland. I later moved down to the United Kingdom where I decided to live in Milton Keynes due to the growing rate of young professional. This also changed my understanding of change my career from hospitality to information technology area of business. This gave me an opportunity to work with the NHS as a flow walker and a Lorenzo professional. I was later encouraged by some of my friend to develop myself in this line of job by going back to the University to get a degree in Business Computing due to my commitment and passion. The intrinsic motivation in me gave me the strong will and passion in taking that clear step of going back to the University to get this degree.
